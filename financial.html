        <h1>Financial Literacy for School Students</h1>
    
        <h2>1. Understanding Financial Literacy</h2>
        <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Financial literacy is the ability to understand and effectively manage personal finance. It includes skills like budgeting, saving, investing, and understanding credit.</p>
    
        <h2>2. Key Topics in Financial Literacy</h2>
    
        <h3>A. Budgeting</h3>
        <p><strong>What is Budgeting?</strong> Budgeting is the process of creating a plan to spend your money. It helps you track income and expenses, ensuring you live within your means.</p>
        <p><strong>How to Create a Budget:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>List Income:</strong> Include all sources of income (allowance, part-time job, gifts).</li>
            <li><strong>Track Expenses:</strong> Write down all monthly expenses (food, entertainment, savings).</li>
            <li><strong>Set Goals:</strong> Decide how much to save and spend in each category.</li>
            <li><strong>Review and Adjust:</strong> Regularly check your budget and make adjustments as needed.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you earn $100 a month, you might allocate $40 for savings, $30 for entertainment, and $30 for food.</p>
    
        <h3>B. Saving</h3>
        <p><strong>Importance of Saving:</strong> Saving money helps you prepare for emergencies and achieve financial goals (like buying a car or going to college).</p>
        <p><strong>Types of Savings:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Emergency Fund:</strong> Money set aside for unexpected expenses (like car repairs).</li>
            <li><strong>Short-term Savings:</strong> For goals within a year (like a new phone).</li>
            <li><strong>Long-term Savings:</strong> For future goals (like college tuition).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Aim to save at least 20% of your income each month.</p>
    
        <h3>C. Banking</h3>
        <p><strong>Types of Accounts:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Checking Account:</strong> For daily transactions; allows easy access to funds.</li>
            <li><strong>Savings Account:</strong> Earns interest on your savings; less accessible than checking.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>How to Use a Bank:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Deposits:</strong> Putting money into your account.</li>
            <li><strong>Withdrawals:</strong> Taking money out of your account.</li>
            <li><strong>Balancing a Checkbook:</strong> Keeping track of your spending to avoid overdrafts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you have $200 in your checking account and spend $50, you should have $150 left.</p>
    
        <h3>D. Credit and Debt</h3>
        <p><strong>What is Credit?</strong> Credit is the ability to borrow money with the promise to pay it back later. It’s important for making large purchases (like cars or homes).</p>
        <p><strong>Types of Credit:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Credit Cards:</strong> Allow you to borrow money up to a limit; must be paid back with interest.</li>
            <li><strong>Loans:</strong> Borrowed money that must be repaid over time (like student loans).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Managing Debt:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pay on Time:</strong> Avoid late fees and damage to your credit score.</li>
            <li><strong>Understand Interest Rates:</strong> Know how much extra you’ll pay when borrowing money.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you borrow $100 at a 10% interest rate, you’ll owe $110 when you pay it back.</p>
    
        <h3>E. Investing</h3>
        <p><strong>What is Investing?</strong> Investing is putting your money into assets (like stocks or bonds) with the expectation of earning a return.</p>
        <p><strong>Types of Investments:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stocks:</strong> Ownership in a company; can provide high returns but come with risks.</li>
            <li><strong>Bonds:</strong> Loans to companies or governments; generally safer than stocks.</li>
            <li><strong>Mutual Funds:</strong> Pools of money from many investors to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Start investing early to take advantage of compound interest, where your earnings generate more earnings over time.</p>
    
        <h3>F. Understanding Financial Risks</h3>
        <p><strong>What is Financial Risk?</strong> The possibility of losing money on an investment or not being able to meet financial obligations.</p>
        <p><strong>Types of Risks:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Market Risk:</strong> The risk of losing money due to market fluctuations.</li>
            <li><strong>Credit Risk:</strong> The risk that a borrower will default on a loan.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Managing Risks:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Diversification:</strong> Spread your investments across different assets to reduce risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Research:</strong> Understand what you’re investing in before committing your money.</li>
        </ul>
